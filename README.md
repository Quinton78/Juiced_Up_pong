I manually added the data folder into the repository. When pulling in the project make sure to put the data folder into the bin folder.
As well makes sure to open the project generator and add these addons to the project. ofxOpenCv, ofxCv, ofxGui.
To add the ofxCv addon you need to grab it from this github repository, (https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCv).
Doing this should allow the project to work as intended
P.S. If you extract the project and you see another folder with the same name as the project, just move it one step back in file explorer and the 2 files should fuse.
